Hey! Welcome to SK3LL!X Games!
------------------------------------
SK3LL!X started out as a high school project but
I just kept adding on to it like the fucking nerd
that i am lol. I plan on updating the site and
even adding more games to it, so shit's gonna
change on here. But if you still don't know what
this is, SK3LL!X is a game site as the repository
name suggests. It's mostly just Friday Night Funkin'
Mods turned HTML5 ports, but I'm doing my best
goddammit, I'm a one man team here! If you're
still here and you read all the way to this point
I really appriciate it. You're the best. But yeah 
idk what else to say so i'm just gonna end it here.
enjoy the site! :)
